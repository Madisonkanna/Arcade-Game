# Frogger Arcade Game
## Frogger Arcade game is a slight cariation of the classic Frogger Arcade Game developed by Konami.

I made this game as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 
## How to play
 When you reach the water, you win the game and the game will start over. If you run into an enemy bug, you will die and the game will start over. THe enemy bugs are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds. 

## How to use the controls
Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.
