# Frogger Arcade Game
## Summary
Frogger Arcade game is a slight cariation of the classic Frogger Arcade Game developed by Konami. I made this game as a project that is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 
## How to play
 When you reach the water, you win the game and the game will start over. If you run into an enemy bug, you will die and the game will start over. THe enemy bugs are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds. 

## How to use the controls
Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.

## Front-end Nanodegree guide to this project

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
